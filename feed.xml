      Introduction

In this post I will be showing you how I analyzed emotet malware in a network log using Wireshark and hopefully this will help you give an idea of what to do and look for when analyzing a network log using Wireshark.

While searching for pcap files to analyze, I came across the site https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/. It is a site that collects network logs from malware so ...

      Introduction

Plotted-TMS is a easy level THM room created by sa.infinity8888.

Recon

Starting with 2 nmap scans, we see that there are 2 services running - SSH and Apache on port 80 and 445.



Visiting both sites leads to a default Apache page so it’s back to recon.

We then see a possible SSH key but it is revealed that th...

      h4cked is an easy CTF room that exercises your skills in network analysis.

Network Analysis Using Wireshark

The story behind this room is that a machine got compromised and now we must examine a .pcap file to find out what happened. The first question asks us what service the attacker is trying to log into.



A quick skim of the log shows that there is a lot of traffic going into the FTP ser...

      The THM room Gallery is an easy level CTF room created to test your skills in SQLi and exploiting known vulnerabilities.

Recon

Start with a simple port scan.



Here we can see that there are two ports open on the system. So the answer to the first question in task 1 is 2. If we were to then visit the website, we would be shown a default page for Apache2 in Ubuntu. However, if we were to visi...
