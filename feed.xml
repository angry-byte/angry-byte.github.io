      The THM library room is a room created to practice SSH network service brute forcing and Python library hijacking.

Enumeration

A little after booting the machine, I start with a nmap scan.



In less than 6 seconds, I see that there are only two ports available. Using the OWASP ZAP, I visited the website.



On the website we don’t see much, however we do see the username “meliodas” and 3 oth...

      Anonforce is an easy room on TryHackMe created to test password cracking skills.
